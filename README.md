# Warui

A Multi-Tenant Financial Application

Bootstrapped with Ash Application Framework & Tigerbeetle OLTP.

Served with Phoenix Liveview.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup.all` to install, setup dependencies and perform tenant migrations
- Run tests with `mix test.watch`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
- For Livebook start with `iex --name myapp --cookie livebook -S mix phx.server`
  Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
  Or play around with [`Livebook`](https://livebook.org) by setting up your --cookie and app-name.

Ready to run in production? Please [check deployment guides on fly.io](fly.io/phoenix)
